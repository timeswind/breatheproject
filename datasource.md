# Datasource Notes

> It depends on whether you are seeking daily pollutant data or hourly pollutant data.  Most of the Smell Pgh app data points are recorded in real time, and so the closest resolution of historical data is hourly data.  You can get this information from the Western PA Regional data center for data going back to 2016.  Here is the the page

[WPRDC](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality)

> Scroll down and you will see “Hourly Air Quality Data.”  

Note that this is a big dataset.  And it includes AQ data for many pollutants.  You will need to download this dataset and then retain only the data pertaining to PM 2.5.  

Note that this page has other useful information, such as maps showing the monitor locations.  It is worth exploring this page.


Another useful site is the EPA’s air quality data site:
