I can't see it, but the odor is intoxicatingly foul and way too frequent.","Headache, light headed, dizziness, shortness of breath, and skin inflammation.","I live in zipcode 15241 near the top of a hill so we may get wind of the air pollution worse because of the elevation. I first noticed the toxic smell on Friday evening January 20th around 7pm and the smell lasted for hours. The smell came back again over that weekend, and now for the third time we are bothered by it and taking action to report it on 1/25/17 around 6pm. The pollution smell is so foul I can't even open the windows but since they were already open I cannot get the smell out of the house either. I already have considerable health problems which makes me more sensitive than the average person to any type of air pollution. That is why my symptoms reported are worse than a healthy person would experience. However the smell bothers the entire family. It is sad that we cannot leave the home windows open without filling the house with air pollution. The air pollution smell is usually non existent, but lately has been a real problem. We hope that filing reports like this with the ACHD can help clean up Pittsburgh's air quality so that we can all breathe cleaner and healthier air that does not make us sick. Thank you."

It is completely unacceptable for Pittsburgh residents to constantly be subject to this poisonous toxic air pollution. This problem occurs about once or twice a week on average usually in the evening and is way too frequent. We can't even leave our home windows open to get fresh air without inadvertently without filling the house with air pollution, only realizing after symptoms occur and by then it's too late. Closing the windows traps the pollution in the house and leaving them open allows more pollution in. It's a catch 22. We hope that the great city of Pittsburgh and the Allegheny Department of Health takes urgent action to stop the toxic industrial air pollution from poisoning all residents, especially in such a densely populated city, so that we can all breathe better. Thank you for your help."

It almost smells like burning trash but worse. This is definitely not wood or campfire smoke, instead this smells toxic and poisonous. The smell is so strong that now we are wondering if it's coming from near by, but can never tell any specific source. The smell is so bad that we cannot even go outside without feeling sick. It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the mouth as well. Our local fire department on route 19, which we live on the hill right above, used to drill or practice on controlled car fires in their empty lot. That was very rare though and I dont believe they do it anymore anyway. So we don't think it's coming from there, but may need to rule it out.

This evening is the worst the air pollution has ever been both symptom wise and odor wise since we started reporting it in recent months. The air pollution usually happens in the evenings but not always and seems more common on the weekends. We first noticed a very faint odor around 6pm today and immediately closed all the windows to the house to prevent it from filling up with air pollution again because this has happened several times before. By 8 to 9pm the odor peaked and was so bad I got sick just from going outside to check on the smell. Even the dog wanted back in as soon as he went outside. It got so bad that I wanted to call 911 to report it and have the police look into it, however this is not technically an emergency so I called the Allegheny health department hotline to report it instead.

I am sorry to keep troubling the health department with these reports, but we have a serious and frequent air pollution problem here that we need to figure out. It's so bad that we actually will have to move away if this problem continues. Please help clean up the air for everyone so that we can all breathe better and healthier. Thank you for all your help."

It's not as bad today as it was last friday when others in the South Hills reported it as well, but it's still very bad. Problem happens once or sometimes twice a week on average. Sad we can't even leave the windows open for fresh air b/c we get air pollution instead. This time it immediately causes a headache and leaves a horrible after taste in the mouth. Can't even go outside. The smell has been going for many hours all evening, progressively worsening and peaked about now around 9:30pm, which is the typical pattern. This time it does not smell like burnt rubber like usual, but still smells like some kind of poisonous toxic industrial polution.  I wish we could figure out where it's coming from, but it could be near or far away. Please help we can't breathe or live in these conditions. "

Based on the SmellPGH map reports of the same smell by many other users, it appears the smell is coming from east of downtown, around the Frick park greater area. This pollution is unbearable and continues to harm our health, please help."

We pray that the pollution does not last for an entire week again, like it did last week.

It seems that many Pittsburgh residents are so used to Pittsburgh's constant air pollution that they either don't pay attention to it or think it's normal. The American Lung Association ranks PGH as one of the worst cities in the country for air quality. This pollution is causing significant health problems for me and my family.  Please help cleanup the air pollution, so we can all breathe better."

I hope that some day the health and well being of pittsburghs residents and their rights and freedom to breathe clean air will be more important than the profits of polluting industries poisoning the air and water. In a city whose economy depends on this dirty energy and pollution industry, progress to clean up the air we all breathe is difficult if not impossible.  Allegheny Health Department, please help, we beg you."

Nausea and vomiting, blurry vision, waxy skin and clothing, sticky furniture and  The stink is bad. We cannot open our doors or windows and outdoor furniture and porch are covered and sticky black ash. The kids are always sick with headaches, gastrointestinal pain, burning lungs and lethargy. Do you know the symptoms associated with exposure to smoke on a regular basis? All of the above!
This toxic stench feels like a chemical attack! It has been occurring for several recent consecutive years now and no matters how much we complain to you it continues and gets worse. The baby is rushed to ER two or three times a month on those smoke filled nights. Why is allowing this more important to you than our quality of life in Bethel Park? Who is paying you off to make babies suffer so you can get rich? DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS BURNING NOW!!!!"

Headache, eyes burning, shortness of breath, dizziness, ","Looking at the air quality index maps and the hourly animated maps on airnow.gov, it seems the air pollution affecting us is from two main places. First the steel/coke industry especially the mon valley works area, which is directly to the east of us. The AQI map clearly shows pollution originating there as well as a few other places and spreading to cover the entire southwest part of the state in yellow and orange. Of course this happens frequently. The second primary source of the air pollution is clearly shown on the AQI map as about half way between PGH and Washington, just west of I-79. What exactly there is polluting I dont know? Do you? But that is right by where we live. The AQI map clearly shows an orange spot originating there and steadily growing (orange meaning AQI over 100 and not safe to breathe). Furthermore, using the SmellPGH smartphone app, we regularly see other residents of the south hills reporting air pollution, some of them are close to us. For example, today we see atleast 3 or 4 other air pollution complaints in the south hills.  I find that most PGH residents are too used to the constant pollution to notice the smells, and the ones who do notice it dont bother to report it because it is so frequent or they are used to it.But all i can do is file a report to document the constant pollution and hope for the best. We know that cleaning up the air pollution in one of the worst polluted cities in the country is no easy task, but we thank the health department for all of their hard work towards a healther environment for us all. Thank you. "

There is no way to get the air pollution out of the house either. What are we supposed to do? Most pgh residents are so used to the pollution they don't even notice it because its always bad. But those of us who are sensitive or with health problems notice it every day. Yesterday there was atleast one other report filed in the south hills, I would have filed one also but was too sick to. This problem is not specific to the south hills though, the air pollution is bad everywhere. Just look at the maps on airnow.gov. All of southwest PA is yellow on the airnow.gov map with parts being orange, all of that air is unsafe to breathe. There arent even any green spots on the map because there hasnt been any clean air for days. Also note recently the south hills has had orange spots on the airnow.giv  map at times which shows particularly bad pollution.  Also we have experienced the air pollution smells throughout the entire county, not just where we live. Thank you to the health department for your help and hard work.  All residents can do is file pollution reports and hope and pray that someday pittsburghers can breathe clean air but that day will not come anytime soon."

This is 3 days in a row of horrible air pollution that's july 3,4,5 and no it's not fireworks this air pollution is a severe problem almost all the time. Its so bad i just dont go outside ever anymore, and it's never safe to open the windows because of the toxic pollution that makes me noticeably ill right away.
Airnow.gov map shows the entire region is yellow and there is a big orange area (aqi over 100) south west of pittsbirgh. Why is it that some of the worst air pollution in pgh is coming from this area? I cant figure out what exactly is causing it all, but there is a clear reoccuring pattern of orange on the airnow.gov maps and it's located just south west of our great city of pgh, about half way between pgh and washington.  Unfortunately we live close to this area maybe thats a big part of the problem. However it is also jmportant to note that today, on the smellPGH smartphone app, there are 4 total air pollution complaints filed all from the south hills of pittsburgh, around the usc/bethel park area. So clearly it's not just us noticing the pollution and experiencing ill effects from it.  I have taken screen shots of all the maps mentioned above if you would like to see them for reference, though they're also freely available from their sources.

Please help figure out why the pollution is so bad and help reduce it. It seems to be particularly worse just south/SW of the city which is strange. Thank you for your help, we really appreciate the health department and all that you do, without you the people would have no advocate for clean air to breathe."

Its so bad i can taste the toxic smell, and immediately got sick from it. The EPA website with air pollution monitoring maps, Airnow.gov has been shut down and is not working. I hope their funding was not cut.  So i cant see a map to try and tell where the pollution is coming from. It could be the clairton coke plants directly to my east? Their pm2.5 levels at Lincoln aqi monitor are elevated today at 24. But it could also be coming from closer, i don't know. Don't see any other smell reports in my area today. This toxic air pollution smell is especially bad today, i cant even go outside without getting sick. And there is no breeze to take away the pollution. Thank you for your help."

 The PGH AQI is currently 61 (moderate). And airnow.gov map shows the entire western PA region in yellow (moderate). The smellPGH app shows there are 4 other industrial air pollution complaints in the south hills alone today. So it's never just us noticing and reporting the pollution. Not to mention the app shows air pollution complaints all over the entire city, but this is normal for PGH. That's how it is literally every day, just look at the map history in the smellPGH app as well as the AQI records on airnow.gov. It's no secret thay PGH has the worst air pollution in the entire country east of Los Angeles. We pray that some day the government will put the health of the people above the proffits of polluters. There is no life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness when we can't breathe because everyones air is polluted. Sadly, feedom to breathe clean air doesn't exist in PGH.  We understand that this great city was built on manufacturing, which is the cause of the rampant widespread pollution to this day, and we get that because of politics we may never have clean air. So in the mean time, all we can do is let the health department know we can't breathe, literally. Thank you for your help. And thank you for bringing attention to this matter.  "

The PGH AQI is 84 (source airnow.gov). The entire PGH region is yellow (moderate) on the airnow.gov maps. The smellPGH smartphone app shows approximately 200 air pollution complaints today alone from different residents throughout the entire PGH area. The map also shows about 20 complaints today in the south hills alone, which is where we live. The Allegheny health department responded to our previous air pollution complaints saying, ""no one else in the south hills is complaining."" Well here's the data proving that on 8/9/17 there were 20 other complaints from the south hills alone (source smellPGH app) and i have taken screenshots in case you would like to see them. This data is all freely and publically available. Furthermore each time we file an air pollution complaint,  first i check the map on the smellPGH app, and i always see multiple complaints in my area already filed by other residents on any given day.

More importantly though, this air pollution problem is not just the south hills, it is the entire city and greater PGH area. This information is easily verifyable using the historical data and maps for PGH on airnow.gov and the smellPGH app. 
August 9th 2017 is one of the worst air pollution days we have had lately and it's lasted for days. 
The airnow.gov animated AQI maps today even shows some of the air pollution originating from the PGH area and spreading far and wide throughout the state.

I am simply submitting this air pollution report so that the health department is aware of the negative impact Pittsburgh's air pollution has on it's residents. Hopefully we can move toward cleaning up the air we all breathe by reducing pollution. Thank you for your help and advocacy."

The air pollution has been unbearable for 4 days in a row now. I already had to go to urgent care because i can't breathe and am sensitive to toxic air pollution which unfortunately is the norm in PGH. 

Today the airnow.gov map clearly shows the pollution is coming from south east of PGH, specifically around the Clairton area. The airnow.hov map is red (unhealthy) for the area south east of the city, but the entire region is yellow (moderate).  Clairton started releasing the toxic smog around 3am today, as you can see from the airnow.gov map. The AQI monitors throughout the entire city are cutrently yellow(moderate) and have been elevated between yellow orange and red for the past 4 days in a row.

Today alone there are about 20 other complaints made by residents in the south hills using the smellPGH app. The AQI monitor at clairton is red, and the airnow.gov maps shows the pollution is clearly coming from Clairton, as usual.  Does clairton just violate the clean air rules every day and get away with it? We are sad that the great city of PGH is riddled with toxic air pollution making us sick unable to breathe outside.

We cant even go outside or open the windows the smell is so toxic and so bad. The airnow.gov charts confirm the problem and shows it coming from Clairton. It's evident that Clairton just violates the clean air act all the time and nothing is done except meaningless fines. What about public health? To be realistic the air pollution in pgh is always bad, but sometimes it's really bad as it has been terrible every day for the past week and most days for the past month. The pollution is so frequent that we don't even bother reporting it every day. Most citizens don't report it at all cause they are used to it.
With more pollution soon to come from the new Shell chemical plant, we can only expect the pollution to get worse. Why are we, the most air polluted city east of LA, still investing in dirty pollution jobs like Shell rather than clean jobs?  No wonder companies like Amazon will never come to pgh. Why is poisoning the public with air pollution ok? This should not even be political but clearly is. There is no freedom and no liberty when air polluters freely poison the air we all breathe and directly harm public health. Why are the profits of polluters private, but the poison is public? The weak and sickly are particularly affected by the pollution. Please help make a change we beg you."

They may be the same pollution that we are smelling and reporting now a few hours later. Typically the air pollution on fridays always comes from clairton, just like clockwork. But we cant tell where the air pollution is coming from right now, but it is the same burnt rubber industrial smell we always get and it's really bad it causes headaches right away.  The only air pollution right now, according to airnow.gov maps is coming from steubenville OH.

About 3-4 times a month or more, we would smell a burning smell that burned our noses and mouths when we breathed. We are from NJ and believe we were more susceptible to the smells because they were new to us. We would have to cover our faves with our shirts and run into the house from the car to avoid the burning every breath. Every morning, we woke  up with headaches...my husband, 3 daughters and I. We suffered allergy tyoe symptoms all year round. As I stated, we moved a month ago and the headaches are gone! No more allergy-like symptoms and it doesnt hurt to breathe. The underground fires are a serious health risk. What happens when PPG closes its doors? Who is responsible for the fires underneath that land? I am so thankful we got out when we did."

As proven by the EPA's airnow.gov air pollution charts today 8/3/19. Pm2.5 is in the red above 100 for the entire south/east region of pittsburgh, as usual. Also note that today alone the health department has received at least 12 complaints from south east of PGH residents about clairtons air pollution, Evidenced by the air pollution comaint map on SmellPGH app. And that's not even counting phone or email complaints. We usually don't bother filing complaint reports anymore with the health department because the pollution is constant. And only getting worse. Especially with the us steel mill expansion in Clairton, they're just going to poison us even more than they already are. Why is our dear beloved Pittsburgh the most poisonous toxic air/land/water pollution in the country? Are we so blatantly corrupt with private for profit industry that destroys the environment, damaging everyrhing in it including humans. Not to mention causing disease disability and death in PGH residents. Looking at the national EPA air quality map today 8/3 at 2pm, PGH is the only RED area in the entire country. So right now, literally, PGH has by far the wors't air pollution in the country. I have documented evidence to prove it incase u can't find the data. Please, we beg you, do atleast something to help reduce the toxic air pollution we breathe in PGH most every day. And i didnt even mention fracking yet which may be even worse than coal and steel mills. I digress. Thank you for your public service. We sincerely appreciate help from the alleghenny county health department. Thank you."
